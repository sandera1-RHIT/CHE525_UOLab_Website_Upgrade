The current website used for downloading project data from the Unit Operations is a good new addition to the lab.  The website was an upgrade from the original process of data download using an SD card to transfer the data between the server and student's laptop.  The current Website layout and design is not the focus of this project as the simplistic interface is easy to understand.  

The website provides selection of the process you want to download data from, the date and time window of the data, and the interval between data points.  This provides a simple way to gather all of the data provided by the process selected process.

On the backside of the website, it connects through python code to the UOLab historian. It collects the requested data and returns everything as a csv.

## New Website
The new website will include all of the same features as the old website, as well as include more features.  The new features being selecting individual instruments from the process, larger variety of time intervals, and a choice of the type of data.
